Early life

Ne Win was born in Hinthada (Henzada), Ayeyarwady Division, the son of Daw Tin, a teacher, and U Thet Pe, a police officer. Born Ne Win, he was given his famous moniker after his successful debut film, Kawleikgyin (The Collegian), so as not to be confused with the late Burmese strongman of the same name, Gen. Ne Win. After graduating from Coming High School in Hinthada, Ne Win enlisted in the Burmese Navy in 1946. He left the navy in 1951 to enroll in Rangoon University. At the university, Ne Win played for the Rangoon University football team as a striker forward. Ne Win proved a talented footballer. He made the Burmese national team in 1955, and won the Best Player award given by the Burma Football Federation in 1956. Ne Win earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1958.

Career

Ne Win made his film debut in 1959 with Kawleikgyin. Director Chinn Sein cast Ne Win, a nationally well-known footballer, to play the title role in his film about a love story between a beautiful girl and a carefree Rangoon University sportsman. The film's enormous popularity instantly made Ne Win one of the leading men of Burmese cinema. Known as Kawliekgyin Ne Win from then on, he remained a leading man in the 1960s, starring in dozens of films.

Starting in the late 1960s, Kawleikgyin Ne Win successfully switched into older, father-figure roles. He won his two Burmese Academy Awards late in his career in 1969 and 1979.
